## Advent of Code 2019

### Testing:  
CMake is configured for testing each day against my input solutions. To use, create a build directory and run `cmake [source_directory]`, followed by `make` to compile the source code. `CTest` can be used to run the test suite. Day 25 is not tested as it does not produce a standard result.
